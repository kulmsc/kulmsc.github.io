<p>These are all the computer labs I wrote for a class I TAâ€™d entitled, Quantiative Genetics and Genomics at Cornell University and Weill Cornell Medicine.  The base of the computer labs were written by Zoe Zhao, you can get see these labs at <a href="https://github.com/zoezhao997/BTRY6830">her github</a>.  There are also video lectures that well correspond to the fundamental mathematics and biology of each lab.  You can find these videos at <a href="http://mezeylab.cb.bscb.cornell.edu/Classes.aspx">Mezey Lab</a>.</p>

<p>There may still be some bugs within the labs, but for the most part they are great.  From basic R to MCMC, these labs provide a way to learn R in the context of genetics.  The labs are all based in R-Markdown, which is something I have not seen in many other R lessons so hopefully you can take advantage of that fact here.  All of these labs are on my <a href="https://github.com/kulmsc/qgg-labs">github</a>.  The contents of the labs are as follows:</p>
