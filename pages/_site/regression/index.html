<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Regression is a technique in the powerful position of being one of the oldest data analysis techniques and also the largest technique within machine learning.  While seeing some points, inherently seeing a pattern and drawing a line seems obvious, there is actually much more to it.  Everything is based on the equation y = Xb.  In this project I hope to teach myself/write up a reference of important regression equations and their derivations.  Whenever possible making things super intuitive, with simulations and examples.</p>

<p>As within nearly all polygenic risk score methods, LDPred begins with a simple linear model connecting phenotypes and genotypes.  Note that in this equation we are regressing all of the variants simultaneously.  This is not how GWASs are carried out, and therefore summary statistics are generated.  However it is the most accurate yet simple model.</p>
