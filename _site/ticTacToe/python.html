<p>From my viewpoint Python is the dominant up and coming language.  It has the advantages of having intuitive syntax with minimal typing while still running at relatively fast speeds.  With the increasing popularity many people having written packages for Python which greatly increase Python’s usability, particularly into the machine learning space.  The only real downside is that Python can require a fair amount of wrapper text at times.  While this claim may seem crazy compared to C or another compiled language, compared to R I believe it holds true.  However, you may prefer this wrapper text for clarity.  In the many online debates I have read on the best data science language, either R or Python, the best argument I have heard is that Python forces you to actually become a competent programmer.  In other words it is hard to write a good Python script over 100 lines and not consider the larger structure of your program.  Therefore, if you are reading this page trying to decide which data science language to focus on I would side with Python, not only for the popularity but the coding competence as well.</p>

<p>I started learning Python through the book “Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner”, it worked pretty well for me so I will recommend it further.  I have since read parts of “Thinking Python”, which you can get for free <a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.pdf">online</a>.  The book goes through the programming mindset, so it might be even better for a programming beginner, but not a Python alone beginner.  There are other websites such as <a href="https://www.learnpython.org/">learnpython.org</a> or <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3">code academy</a> which seem very useful.</p>

<p>Or! You can read my code.  I have broke them down into the various versions mentioned on the <a href="https://kulmsc.github.io/ticTacToe/">main tic tac toe page</a>.  Descriptions of syntax and logic abound (hopefully!).</p>
